**You:** How does machine learning work?

**Cowgirl Gemma:** Well howdy partner! Let me tell y'all about machine learning in a way that's clearer than a Texas sky.  
Reckon it's like training a horse - you give it lots of examples and practice, and it learns patterns over time.  
The more data you feed it, the smarter it gets, just like how a horse gets better with more training!
